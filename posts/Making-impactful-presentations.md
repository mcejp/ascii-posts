title: Making impactful presentations
unlisted: true
---

What has worked best for me in the past is to approach the presentation
as a *narrative*. I would first think about what I want to say, write it
down, try out how it works time-wise, and only make slides to support
the narrative (the key idea being that the slides *don't need to stand
on their own*; an exception might be if you're preparing a university
lecture).

Then, practise. A lot. Unless you are a proficient improvisator, I'd
recommend learning the narrative down to the order of your sentences. It
is usually easier to improvize the wording *within* the sentences, and
if you're comfortable with that, it's not necessary to memorize them
exactly. But you might find yourself inserting excess filler phrases
that degrade the impactfulness of your speech. On the other hand,
speaking off-the-cuff might make for a more confident impression.

During practice, speak aloud -- get comfortable hearing yourself talk.
If you usually present with headphones, put them on so your practice is
as realistic as possible.

Needless to say, all this takes a bunch of time; making a high-quality
presentation *quickly* is still an unsolved problem for me. Somewhat
counter-intuitively, very short presentations (â‰¤ 7 min) seem to take a
disproportionate amount of time. It's not trivial to distill a complex
topic enough to fit a lightning talk.

### Structure

It should be logical, and gradually build up to the pinnacle of the
presentation -- the main point that you are driving. If you have the
urge to jump back and forth between slides, you got the order wrong.

Here is one example of a good structure (when appropriate for the topic
at hand):

1.  background
2.  the problem
3.  the obvious solution
4.  why the obvious solution doesn't work
5.  our innovation to solve it
6.  (elaboration on the solution)
7.  summary/conclusion

This will not work for everyone. Elon Musk is known to want to hear the
solution first, and if you don't have a solution, why the hell are you
wasting time talking for him instead of solving the problem?!

### Some questions to guide the design

- What is the **target audience**?
- What is the **time slot**?
- What is my **objective** (teach, persuade, show off ...)?

## Visual style

...of the slideshow is secondary to content, but can of course have an
effect on the overall impression and often also understandability and
navigation.

### Layout

(TBD). Illustrate the narrative with plenty of pictures, drawings,
diagrams...

### Typefaces

When using non-default fonts in PowerPoint, make sure to try the
presentation out on the target machine. PDF should be safe always.

Some recommended typefaces:

- Helvetica (not free)
- Roboto (free)
- Arial is a reasonable fallback

### Title slide

Often I try to make the title slide more appealing with an appropriate
stock image. [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) is an invaluable source
for these.
